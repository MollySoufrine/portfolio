                I am fairly new to web development, just starting my journey in
                May 2020. Although I have no background experience I approach
                every learning opportunity head on with an open mind to gain
                progression. I have a Bachelors degree in Exercise Science and
                leverage an experienced background in customer service. I have
                recently graduated from a Full Stack Web Development bootcamp
                through Uconn October 2020 where I was introduced to skills for
                JavaScript, CSS, Node.js, React.js, Mysql, nosql and responsive
                web design.

                I've quickly begun exploring more indepth what can be done
                within the world of Web Development and beyond. At the moment I
                have an internship with
                <b>TN Integrated Solutions</b>. This internship has helped me
                discover that i enjoy writing tests for functions and solving
                any problems or puzzles our code reveals. From this opportunity
                I have alreayd begun to expand my knowledge. I have been apart
                of numerous projects developing and designing websites for
                clients as well as writing tests in PHPUnit to write more
                effiecient code as well as debug. I am hoping to learn more
                about the freelance opportunities, servers, managing databases,
                testing code and using other languages as well for development.

                I am also a tutor for 2U Trilogy Ed for students who went
                through the same bootcamp I completed. This gives me the
                opportunity to not only give back but to rehearse the skills I
                have learned. It's very satisfying to guide someone and see them
                fully grasp a concept they were struggling with previously.
                Coming from a background with no experience within this field I
                always like to remind students as well as myself that they're
                doing a great job and it takes a lot of work but it's worth it.
