Although I have no background experience I approach\n                every learning opportunity head on with an open mind to gain\n                progression. I have a Bachelors degree in Exercise Science and\n                leverage an experienced background in customer service. I have\n                recently graduated from a Full Stack Web Development bootcamp\n                through Uconn October 2020 where I was introduced to skills for\n                JavaScript, CSS, Node.js, React.js, Mysql, nosql and responsive\n                web design.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"row\">\n            <div className=\"col-md-6\">\n              <p>\n                I've quickly begun exploring more indepth what can be done\n                within the world of Web Development and beyond. At the moment I\n                have an internship with\n                <b>TN Integrated Solutions</b>. This internship has helped me\n                discover that i enjoy writing tests for functions and solving\n                any problems or puzzles our code reveals. From this opportunity\n                I have alreayd begun to expand my knowledge. I have been apart\n                of numerous projects developing and designing websites for\n                clients as well as writing tests in PHPUnit to write more\n                effiecient code as well as debug. I am hoping to learn more\n                about the freelance opportunities, servers, managing databases,\n                testing code and using other languages as well for development.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"col-md-6\">\n              <p>\n                I am also a tutor for 2U Trilogy Ed for students who went\n                through the same bootcamp I completed. This gives me the\n                opportunity to not only give back but to rehearse the skills I\n                have learned. It's very satisfying to guide someone and see them\n                fully grasp a concept they were struggling with previously.\n                Coming from a background with no experience within this field I\n                always like to remind students as well as myself that they're\n                doing a great job and it takes a lot of work but it's worth it.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Home;\n","import React from \"react\";\n\nfunction Portfolio() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <div className=\"container\">\n        <div className=\"myPortfolio\">\n          <div className=\"row\">\n            <div className=\"col\">\n              <h2>My Portfolio</h2>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"row\">\n            <div className=\"col-md-4\">\n              <p>\n                With my time spent in this bootcamp I have learned how to use\n                HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node and Express.js, React.js, MongoDB,\n                MySQL and API's. My github account{\" \"}\n                <a href=\"https://github.com/MollySoufrine?tab=repositories\">\n                  MollySoufrine\n                </a>{\" \"}\n                , has all of my repos for the class activities, homework\n                assignemts, projects and outside class work I have completed. As\n                far as work done outside the class room, I have tried to find\n                projects online either by following videos on youtube or written\n                instructions from an information website or course from udemy.\n                Udemy was first suggested to me to better my skills with\n                JavaScript and it has helped tremendously. I've realized within\n                this industry so much changes that it is important to continue\n                practcing your skills while learning more.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n\n            <div className=\"col-md-4\">\n              <p>\n                One assignment I enjoyed was a{\" \"}\n                <a href=\"https://github.com/MollySoufrine/noteTaker\">\n                  Note Take\n                </a>{\" \"}\n                that required us to use JS express and node. At first I had a\n                challenging time with this assignment as I didnt fully\n                understand routes at the beginning but with time I have\n                developed a better grasp on their importance. The function of\n                this assignment is to be able to write a title for your todo or\n                note, write your note and be able to save it. Once you have\n                saved it, you could cross it off once it is completed or even\n                delete it.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"col-md-4\">\n              <p>\n                For my internship with TN Integrations we use Gitlab to store\n                our repositories, however, they are all private. Our most recent\n                project though has taught me about PHPunit testing and I'm\n                excited to become more involved with testing code. My mentor has\n                developed a program for a local restaurant to have multiple\n                subscriptions for weekly meals where customers can add on food\n                items or skip a week. They can be picked up or delivered and the\n                subscribers delivery date is calculated based on their zip code\n                within two counties. For this project I have been actively\n                creating data providers to test a few of our functions. A few\n                examples of tests and data providers I have made are checking\n                whether an order for add-ons has been placed before or after the\n                cutoff date, creating a customer and order to then be able to\n                test other subscriptions and shipping functions.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Portfolio;\n","import React from \"react\";\n\nfunction Contact() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <div className=\"container\">\n        <div className=\"contactMe\">\n          <div className=\"row\">\n            <div className=\"col-12\">\n              <h2>Contact Info</h2>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"row\">\n            <div className=\"col-md-12\">\n              <p>\n                I can be contacted through my{\" \"}\n                <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/molly-soufrine-449b811a6/\">\n                  LinkedIn account\n                </a>{\" \"}\n                or by email at mollysoufrine@gmail.com.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Contact;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\nfunction Navbar() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <div className=\"container \">\n        <nav className=\"navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-dark bg-dark \">\n          <h1 className=\"navbar-brand font-weight-bold  \">Molly Soufrine</h1>\n          <button\n            className=\"navbar-toggler\"\n            type=\"button\"\n            data-toggle=\"collapse\"\n            data-target=\"#navbarNav\"\n            aria-controls=\"navbarNav\"\n            aria-expanded=\"false\"\n            aria-label=\"Toggle navigation\"\n          >\n            <span className=\"navbar-toggler-icon\" />\n          </button>\n          <div className=\"collapse navbar-collapse\" id=\"navbarNav\">\n            <ul className=\"navbar-nav ml-auto\">\n              <li className=\"nav-item \">\n                <Link className=\"nav-link text-info font-weight-bold\" to=\"/\">\n                  Home\n                </Link>\n              </li>\n              <li className=\"nav-item\">\n                <Link\n                  className=\"nav-link text-info font-weight-bold\"\n                  to=\"/contact\"\n                >\n                  Contact\n                </Link>\n              </li>\n              <li className=\"nav-item\">\n                <Link\n                  className=\"nav-link text-info font-weight-bold\"\n                  to=\"portfolio\"\n                >\n                  Portfolio\n                </Link>\n              </li>\n            </ul>\n            g\n          </div>\n        </nav>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Navbar;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { BrowserRouter, Route, Switch } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport Home from \"./pages/Home\";\nimport Portfolio from \"./pages/Portfolio\";\nimport Contact from \"./pages/Contact\";\nimport Navbar from \"./components/Navbar\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App border border-info\">\n      <BrowserRouter>\n        <Navbar />\n        <Switch>\n          <Route exact path=\"/\" component={Home} />\n          <Route exact path=\"/portfolio\" component={Portfolio} />\n          <Route exact path=\"/contact\" component={Contact} />\n        </Switch>\n      </BrowserRouter>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n//switch seperates the routes\n\nexport default App;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\nimport \"./index.css\";\nimport App from \"./App\";\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById(\"root\")\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
